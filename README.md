# depthrush
Work in progress Kinect driver for Dancerush Stardom.

## Installation
1. Patch SpiceTools to disable all DRS pad hooks.
2. Copy all three of the files from to the same folder as spice64 and use spicecfg to inject `depthrush.dll`.
3. **IMPORTANT:** Open `depthrushConfig.exe` and calibrate your Kinect environment! Otherwise it won't work well with the game.
